# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a simple, educational, professional marketing website for “Manthan Academy” in English with consistent branding and clear navigation.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement a cohesive visual theme (colors, typography, spacing, reusable components) suitable for an educational institute, avoiding blue/purple as the primary theme.
- Add a site-wide header and footer with working internal navigation links: Home, About Teacher, Courses, Contact (with active/current state).
- Create pages:
  - Home: hero with “Manthan Academy”, brief intro/tagline, offerings (CBSE support, Spoken English, English Grammar), and a primary CTA to Contact.
  - About Teacher: profile for “Digvijay Karn” as teacher at Manthan Academy with a concise professional bio and teaching focus areas.
  - Courses: scannable cards/sections for CBSE Support, Spoken English, English Grammar with brief descriptions and contact/enroll prompts linking to Contact.
  - Contact: placeholders for Phone/Email/Address and a simple form (Name, Phone/Email, Message) that provides an outcome without external services (mailto or on-screen confirmation).
- Add generated static images under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and display them (logo in header/footer; hero visual on Home and optionally About) with responsive sizing and alt text.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a responsive, professional Manthan Academy website, learn about the teacher and courses, and submit a basic contact form or navigate to contact details via clear internal links.
